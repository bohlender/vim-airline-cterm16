# vim-airline-cterm16

This is a theme for [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) that does not introduce any colours on its own but uses the terminal's 16 colour palette.
This is helpful if you aim for a consistent color scheme across all terminal applications.

In my case, the result looks as follows:
![Example](/example.png?raw=true "Example")
